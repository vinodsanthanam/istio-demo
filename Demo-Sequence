service discovery - overall service call chains with names instead of ip address
Egress - make enable-egress
Health - Show toggle and pod restarts
Tracing - 
uncomment forward trace headers and build, deploy

Canary - 
Uncomment log for canary and build docker image (docker build vinodsanthanam/api:canary .) and make canary

Fault Injection - make inject-fault (Injected fault in Service C)
This is to demonstrate how to inject fault without modifying code for testing

Retries - 
modify code to pass traceheaders and deploy all
modify code to create failure "docker build vinodsanthanam/api:fail ." and "make retries"
for retries make sure you scale after the failures to demonstrate retries send retry requests to different pods (no more 503's)
